## About the project

A language learning app that strives to make learning a new language easier and more accessible to everyone. Unlike other language learning apps, we focus on the reading aspect of learning a new language. We achieve that by using a database of longer texts written in the language the user is learning. The user can then read the text and pick words or phrases that user wants to learn. After that, the user can learn these words or phrases via many learnig methods.

Learning methods include:

- Flashcards
- Fill in the blanks
- Quiz
- Fix the sentance

## Learning methods

We selected these approaches due to their proven effectiveness in language acquisition. Not only are they widely recognized for their efficiency, but they also align with our goal of simplifying the language learning process. Our app leverages these established methods, rather than attempting to create new ones, to ensure our users have the best tools at their disposal. We believe in utilizing what works best and making it accessible, which is why we opted for these strategies.

Before we can utilze any of these methods, we need to have a set of words or phrases that the user wants to learn. The user can select these words or phrases by highlighting them in the text. The user can then select the learning method user wants to use.
